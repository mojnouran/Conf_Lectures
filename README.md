# Workshops at the Joint Congress of Computational Intelligence

This repository hosts materials from two workshops held at the Joint Congress of Computational Intelligence, focusing on advanced topics in fuzzy systems and decision making with a cognitive approach.

## Workshop 1: Advanced Topics in Fuzzy Systems

### Z-numbers

- **Prepared by:** Mr. Amir Samadi
- **Presentation by:** Mojtaba Nourani
- **Description:** This presentation introduced the concept of z-numbers, which extend fuzzy logic by incorporating reliability measures, and discussed their applications in decision making under uncertainty.



## Workshop 2: Decision Making with Cognitive Approach

### Distributed Compensation Scheme using Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Systems

- **Preparation and Presentation:** Mojtaba Nourani
- **Description:** This session explored the use of Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy models in distributed compensation schemes, highlighting their role in multi-agent systems and decentralized control.

### Multi-criteria Fuzzy Decision Making

- **Prepared and Presented by:** Mojtaba Nourani
- **Description:** This topic covered methods for making decisions involving multiple criteria under uncertainty, utilizing fuzzy logic to handle imprecise information.
